Giants Sell You Out&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You might think you have nothing to hide. But this is not true. In the 
U.S., &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B00505UZ4G/ref=nosim/0sil8" title="Three Felonies A Day by Harvey Silverglate"&gt;you are probably committing at least a felony a day&lt;/a&gt; and 
protesting against a nuclear power plant will get you 
&lt;a href="http://topinfopost.com/2013/05/31/82-year-old-nun-about-to-be-sentenced-as-a-terrorist" title="82 year old nun about to be sentenced as a terrorist"&gt;labeled as a terrorist&lt;/a&gt;, even if you are an 82-year-old nun.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Austria, protesting against the sale of fur in a clothing store 
&lt;a href="https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wiener_neust%C3%A4dter_Tiersch%C3%BCtzerprozess#Ermittlungen_und_Verhaftungen" title="Wiener Neustädter Tierschützerprozess - Sorry only in German"&gt;can land you in jail for several months&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But even if you did nothing wrong, you can end up the target of a federal 
investigation like this &lt;a href="http://www.komonews.com/news/archive/4125406.html" title="Portland Lawyer Cleared In Madrid Bombing Case"&gt;lawyer from Portland&lt;/a&gt; or on the 
&lt;a href="http://www.mercurynews.com/crime-courts/ci_24911422/u-s-government-loses-challenge-no-fly-lists" title="No-fly list challenged: Stanford student wrongly labeled a terrorist, judge says"&gt;no fly list&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In all these cases, the companies that you entrusted with your data must and 
will turn all information they have on you over to the government. And it is 
hard to condemn them. The law compels them to cooperate with law enforcement 
and even where it doesn't, &lt;a href="http://www.dailykos.com/story/2013/10/01/1243061/-Qwest-CEO-Who-Resisted-NSA-Spying-Finally-Released-From-Prison-After-Four-Years-of-Incarceration" title="Qwest CEO Who Resisted NSA Spying Finally Released From Prison After Four Years of Incarceration"&gt;non-compliant executives face retaliation&lt;/a&gt; 
nevertheless.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The data requested by the various agencies are not always used to look for 
terrorists. Sometimes the people there just want to &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;a href="http://blogs.wsj.com/washwire/2013/08/23/nsa-officers-sometimes-spy-on-love-interests/" title="NSA Officers Spy on Love Interests"&gt;stalk their ex-partners or love interests&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lesson to learn:&lt;/strong&gt; Whatever you store on a giant's server can and will be used
against you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;2. Giants Spy On You&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We already established that the giants help the government to spy on you. But 
they themselves wouldn't, right? It's their pitch that your data is safe with 
them, right? Dropbox even claimed that files you upload are inaccessible without your 
account password. &lt;a href="http://www.wired.com/2011/05/dropbox-ftc/" title="Dropbox Lied to Users About Data Security, Complaint to FTC Alleges"&gt;That turned out to be not entirely true&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But who cares that they can look at your data? Why would
they snoop, right? They will not in most cases. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;a href="http://money.cnn.com/2014/03/21/technology/security/microsoft-email/index.html" title="Microsoft defends its right to read your email"&gt;Unless someone sent you information about a leaked Windows 8 image&lt;/a&gt; 
to your Hotmail account, that is. Then they will read your mail, your instant messages and whatever else in your account that interests them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lesson to learn:&lt;/strong&gt; The giants will spy on you if it serves them. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;3. Giants Die&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You probably assume that Gmail or Dropbox will be there forever; so did the
people using MySpace. But would you bet on the fact that it will be here 5 
years from now? The former users of &lt;a href="http://www.engadget.com/2014/05/23/springpad-shutting-down/" title="Springpad shutting down"&gt;Springpad&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://research.gigaom.com/2013/08/evernote-competitor-catch-to-shut-down/" title="Evernote competitor Catch to shut down"&gt;Catch&lt;/a&gt;,
&lt;a href="http://edition.cnn.com/2013/03/14/tech/web/google-reader-discontinued/index.html" title="Google Reader shutting down"&gt;Google Reader&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2014/04/ubuntu-one-storage-and-music-service-shut-down-by-canonical/" title="Ubuntu One storage and music service shut down by Canonical"&gt;Ubuntu One&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/may/20/why-did-lavabit-shut-down-snowden-email" title="Secrets, lies and Snowden's email: why I was forced to shut down Lavabit"&gt;Lavabit&lt;/a&gt; and 
&lt;a href="http://techcrunch.com/2013/02/15/posterous-will-shut-down-on-april-30th-co-founder-garry-tan-launches-posthaven-to-save-your-sites/" title="Posterous Will Shut Down On April 30th, Co-Founder Garry Tan Launches Posthaven To Save Your Sites"&gt;Posterous&lt;/a&gt; might bet against you. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All these services started with grand goals and became integral to the workflow 
of many users, yet they all had their &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IkJqKOb0ZhY" title="... and like that, it's gone"&gt;Keyser Söze Moment&lt;/a&gt; 
when they were shut down for different reasons.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For a company that gives you something for "free," you are always just a cost 
center. If they cannot profit from you, or even if they cannot profit enough, 
your data that you deem safe and sound in their vault lives on borrowed time.
Sooner or later you will be shown the door unceremoniously, and only if you are 
lucky will they let you collect your belongings through a convenient export 
tool. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, you are a little bit safer if you use a paid service. But examples 
like &lt;a href="http://www.your-digital-life.com/photo-sharing-site-everpix-shutting-down/" title="Photo-Sharing Site Everpix Shutting Down"&gt;Everpix&lt;/a&gt; show that there is no guarantee when you pay for a service. Even 
thousands of paying users could not save the site. And the latest blog post by 
&lt;a href="http://blog.app.net/2014/05/06/app-net-state-of-the-union/" title="App.net State of the Union"&gt;app.net&lt;/a&gt;, despite professing a guarantee to keep the site up "indefinitely," 
did not convey the jubilant optimism of a thriving project.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lesson to learn:&lt;/strong&gt; Only if you have full control over where and how your data is 
stored will you be able to rest assured that you won't find yourself scrambling to find a 
new home for your data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;4. Giants Err&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While giants are usually swift to throw their immeasurable resources at 
problems and can usually fix them fast, this is offset by the sheer number of 
affected users.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And sometimes the solution to &lt;a href="http://thenextweb.com/insider/2013/01/07/yahoo-mail-users-hit-by-widespread-hacking-xss-exploit-seemingly-to-blame/" title="Yahoo Mail users hit by widespread hacking, XSS exploit seemingly to blame (Update: Fixed)"&gt;a problem&lt;/a&gt; 
&lt;a href="http://www.offensive-security.com/offsec/yahoo-dom-xss-0day-prevails/" title="Yahoo DOM XSS 0day – Not fixed yet!"&gt;is not as effective as the giant would wish&lt;/a&gt; or proves to be 
&lt;a href="http://appleinsider.com/articles/09/10/11/microsofts_danger_sidekick_data_loss_casts_dark_on_cloud_computing" title="Microsoft's Danger Sidekick data loss casts dark on cloud computing"&gt;genuinely unfixable&lt;/a&gt; because data has been 
&lt;a href="http://www.developerfusion.com/news/112985/gmail-data-loss-bug-causes-complete-data-loss-calls-for-tape-backups/" title="Gmail data loss bug causes complete data loss, calls for tape backups"&gt;irreversibly lost&lt;/a&gt;. Only 0.2% of users were affected in 
the Gmail incident. These 0.2%, however, amounted to 150,000 users who had their 
emails wiped.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lesson to learn:&lt;/strong&gt; If giants err, it affects a lot of people, even if for 
the giant it isn't more than a rounding error.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;5. Giants Don't Care&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most people will never have their Google account suspended. Most people also never have their 
house burglarized. So &lt;a href="http://www.slate.com/articles/technology/future_tense/2013/04/life_without_google_when_my_account_was_suspended_i_felt_like_i_d_been_dumped.html" title="Can You Live Without Google?"&gt;when Google shuts you out&lt;/a&gt;
and you have no way to reach a human to reverse the decision, you will probably feel 
like &lt;a href="http://www.gocomics.com/calvinandhobbes/2014/05/20" title="This is one of the things you always figure will happen to other people. - Unfortunately we're all someone else to someone else"&gt;little Calvin's parents&lt;/a&gt;, betrayed and a little hysterical. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Clearly, you should have carefully read the 
&lt;a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-GB/windows-live/code-of-conduct" title="Windows Life - Code of Conduct"&gt;code of conduct for Microsoft's Live account&lt;/a&gt; before you 
uploaded &lt;a href="http://www.geek.com/news/skydrive-account-suspensions-prove-you-cant-trust-cloud-storage-1503931/" title="SkyDrive account suspensions prove you can’t trust cloud storage"&gt;partial human nudity&lt;/a&gt; to your SkyDrive account after your 
beach vacation. Now you got yourself locked out of your emails, pictures, music 
and your online gaming account because an algorithm thought you were sharing 
porn. You almost wish it were a human sifting through all your pictures at this 
point.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sometimes, however, you will never learn why your account was suspended, like the
poor fellow who fell into &lt;a href="http://www.thegeekprofessor.com/arguing-a-yahoo-account-suspension/" title="Arguing a Yahoo! Account Suspension"&gt;Yahoo's Kafkaesque rabbit hole&lt;/a&gt; and only gained
back access to his email account one month and a complaint to the Better 
Business Bureau later.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lesson to learn:&lt;/strong&gt; Don't expect help by humans if a giant's algorithm locks you
out of your account.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If this convinced you to take control over your data, in the next post 
we will present you with some great projects that make it easy for you to &lt;a href="https://cloudfleet.io/"&gt;be 
the  captain of your data&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;</summary><category term="self-hosting"></category><category term="decentralization"></category></entry></feed>
