Summary: Giants do not care about you. That's why you should stay away from them.




## 1. Giants Sell You Out

You might think you have nothing to hide. But this is not true. In the 
US [you are probably committing at least a felony a day][3-felonies] and 
protesting against a nuclear power plant will get you 
[labeled as terrorist][terrorist-nun], even if you are an 82-year-old nun.

In Austria protesting against the sale of fur in a clothing store 
[can land you in jail for several months][animal-rights]. 

But even if you did nothing wrong, you can end up the target of a federal 
investigation like this [lawyer from Portland][portland-lawyer] or on the 
[no fly list][no-fly-list].

In all these cases, the companies that you entrusted with your data must and 
will turn every information they have on you over to the government. And it is 
hard to condemn them. The law compels them to cooperate with law enforcement 
and if it doesn't [non-compliant executives face retaliation][qwest] 
nevertheless.

And the data requested by the various agencies are not always used to look for 
terrorists. Sometimes the people there just want to   
[stalk their ex-partners or love interests][loveint]. 

__Lesson to learn:__ Whatever you store on a giant's server can and will be used
against you.

## 2. Giants Spy On You

We already established that the giants help the government to spy on you. But 
they themselves wouldn't, right? It's their pitch that your data is safe with 
them, right? Dropbox even claimed that the files are inaccessible without your 
account password. [That turned out to be not entirely true][dropbox-claim].

But who cares that they can look at your data as long as they don't? Why would
they, right? They will not in most cases.   
[Unless someone sent you information about a leaked Windows 8 image][hotmail-blogger] 
to your Hotmail account, that is. Then they will read your mail, your instant messages and whatever else in your account interests them.

__Lesson to learn:__ The giants will spy on you if it serves them. 


## 3. Giants Die

You probably assume that Gmail or Dropbox will be there forever; so did the
people using MySpace. But would you bet on the fact that it will be here 5 
years from now? The former users of [Springpad][], [Catch][],
[Google Reader][google-reader], [Ubuntu One][ubuntu-one], [Lavabit][] and 
[Posterous][] might bet against you. 

All these services started with grand goals and became integral to the workflow 
of many users, yet they all had their [Keyser Söze Moment][keyser-soze-moment] 
when they were shut down for different reasons.

For a company that gives you something for "free", you are always just a cost 
center. If they cannot profit from you, or even if they cannot profit enough, 
your data that you deem safe and sound in their vault lives on borrowed time.
Sooner or later you will be shown the door unceremoniously, and only if you are 
lucky will they let you collect your belongings through a convenient export 
tool. 

Of course you are a little bit safer if you use a paid service. But examples 
like [Everpix][] show that there is no guarantee in paying for a service. Even 
thousands of paying users could not save the site. And the last statement by 
[app.net][], despite professing a guarantee to keep the site up "indefinitely", 
did not convey the jubilant air of a thriving project.

__Lesson to learn:__ Only if you have full control over where and how your data is 
stored, you can rest assured that you don't find yourself scrambling to find a 
new home for your data.



## 4. Giants Err

While giants usually are swift to throw some of their immeasurable manpower at 
problems and usually fix them fast, this is offset by the sheer numbers of 
affected users.

And sometimes the fix to [a problem][yahoo-xss] 
[is not as effective as the giant wishes][yahoo-xss-2] or proves to be 
[genuinely unfixable][microsoft-danger] because data has been 
[irreversibly lost][google-data-loss]. Only 0.2% of the users were affected in 
the Gmail incident. These 0.2% however were over 150.000 users that had their 
emails wiped.

__Lesson to learn:__ If giants err, it affects a lot of people. Even if for 
the giant it isn't more than a rounding error.

## 5. Giants Don't Care

Sure, for most people Google works always. Most people also never have their 
house burglarized. So [when Google suspends your account][google-suspension]
and you have no way to reach a human to reverse the decision you probably feel 
like [little Calvin's parents][calvin], betrayed and a little hysterical. 

But clearly you should have carefully read the 
[code of conduct for Microsoft's Live account][live-coc] before you 
uploaded [partial human nudity][skydrive] to your SkyDrive account after your 
beach vacation. Now you got yourself locked out of your emails, pictures, music 
and your online gaming account because an algorithm thought you were sharing 
porn. You almost wish a human would sift through all your pictures at this 
point.

Sometimes however, you will never learn why your account was suspended like the
poor fellow who fell into [Yahoo's kafkaesk rabbit hole][yahoo] and only gained
back access to his email account one month and a complaint to the Better 
Business Bureau later.

__Lesson to learn:__ Don't expect help by humans if a giant's algorithm locks you
out of your account.


## Conclusion

If this did not convince you to take control over your data, in the next post 
we will present you with some great projects, that make it easy for you to [be 
the  captain of your data][cloudfleet]!
