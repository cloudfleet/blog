Summary: Giants do not care about you. That's why you should stay away from them


## 1. Giants sell you out

You might think you have nothing to hide. But this is not true. In the 
US [you are probably committing at least a felony a day](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B00505UZ4G/ref=nosim/0sil8 
"Three Felonies A Day by Harvey Silverglate") and protesting agains a nuclear
power plant will get you [labeled as terrorist](http://topinfopost.com/2013/05/31/82-year-old-nun-about-to-be-sentenced-as-a-terrorist 
"82 year old nun about to be sentenced as a terrorist") even if you are a 82 
year old nun.

In Austria protesting against the sale of fur in a clothing store 
[can land you in jail for several months](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wiener_neust%C3%A4dter_Tiersch%C3%BCtzerprozess#Ermittlungen_und_Verhaftungen 
"Wiener Neustädter Tierschützerprozess - Sorry only in German"). 

But even if you did nothing wrong you can end up the target of a federal 
investigation like this [lawyer from Portland](http://www.komonews.com/news/archive/4125406.html "Portland Lawyer Cleared In Madrid Bombing Case") 
or on the [no fly list](http://www.mercurynews.com/crime-courts/ci_24911422/u-s-government-loses-challenge-no-fly-lists 
"No-fly list challenged: Stanford student wrongly labeled a terrorist, judge says").

In all these cases 

## 2. Giants Don't Care

Sure for most people Google works always. Most people also never have their 
house burglarized. So [when Google suspends your account](http://www.slate.com/articles/technology/future_tense/2013/04/life_without_google_when_my_account_was_suspended_i_felt_like_i_d_been_dumped.html 
"Can You Live Without Google?")
and you have no way to reach a human to reverse the decision you probably feel 
like [little Calvin's parents](http://www.gocomics.com/calvinandhobbes/2014/05/20 
"This is one of the things you always figure will happen to other people. - Unfortunately we're all someone else to someone else"),
betrayed and a little hysterical.
