Summary: An introduction into redecentralization and Data Autonomy


This is the story of a conference and how it helped with the crystallization of
an idea.

##  Before The Conference

When I read about the conference on the [redecentralize](http://redecentralize.org/)
mailing list, I knew [CloudFleet](https://cloudfleet.io) must be represented
there. The case for redecentralization was at the core of CloudFleet even before
the project had taken the form name and scope it has now.

Being buried deep in engineering problems to create a safe and secure mail
server that is ready for everyone we had neglected most of outside contact in
the last months. Now with a usable product in sight, it was time to get out of
the building and recalibrate with the needs of the people we build CloudFleet
for. We were confident the redecentralize conference - organized by the
incredible [Irina Bolychevsky](http://shevski.com/) - would bring together
people who understand what we want to achieve. I was not disappointed.

Arriving at the conference I had three goals. The first was to present
CloudFleet to a crowd of decentralization enthusiasts and collect feedback if we
are moving in the right direction. The second was to connect with other projects
we could use in our quest to create a private data center. The third one was to
introduce and explore the concept of Data Autonomy, something we deem necessary
for decentralization and want to enable with CloudFleet.

## Feedback

I was pretty sure that the concept of a self-hosted mail server, that grows into
a private data center would resonate with the people at the conference. What I
was a bit insecure about was if people would be ready to pay money for it.

After all most participants of the conference had already installed tools that
allowed them to get rid of one or the other cloud service and many would not
have a hard time installing a mail server by themselves.

But my expectations were exceeded by far. I heard from a number of people that
they would be ready to buy it on the spot and I could have sold some devices
even there. Too bad our engineering wasn't thee yet.

CloudFleet was even mentioned in the finishing panel discussion as example how
we redecentralization could find its way in to the minds and hearts of people.

Now two months later and in the middle of the feverish effort to prepare our
crowdfunding campaign, this makes me hope we will be able to start

## Connections

I connected with many really interesting people at the conference, so I'll just
talk about the ones with the most direct relevance for CloudFleet.

Tristan from [CozyCloud](https://cozy.io/en/) was there, who have similar goals
with a slightly different approach. I managed to talk to the guys from
[Matrix](matrix.org), an open protocol for real time communication that works
over https and has federation baked in and we had a very interesting discussion
on how to simplify the deployment of decentralized services.


## Data Autonomy

On a hot summer day, while contemplating how to frame the problem we want to
solve with CloudFleet, the term Data Autonomy formed in my head. The sovereignty
of individuals over their data.

The redecentralize conference was the perfect environment to pull this concept
down from abstract heights and start talking about what Data Autonomy really
means.

We had a small but intense discussion in which we explored different forms of
data generation and how data ownership can be defined. And while the ideas where
still fluid after this session, it set the seed for the definition of the three
powers that define Data Autonomy:

**The Power of Knowledge**

Knowledge is the possibility to know what data exists about us. Very often
nowadays we are not told what data is collected about us. The Europe vs.
Facebook case illustrated this problem very well, but arguably more data is
collected by government actors.

**The Power of Access**

Besides the obvious fact that we do not have access to data we don't know are
being collected, cloud providers also can cut off access to our accounts for
seemingly arbitrary reasons, leading to a loss of access to data we collected
for our own use.

**The Power of Control**

Control entails the possibility to decide what data about us we want to share
with whom. This concerns data that we collect, like photo albums or emails, but
also data that is collected about us, like energy use or credit card
transactions.
