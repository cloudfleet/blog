In 1943 Thomas Watson - then president of IBM - proclaimed he saw a worldwide
market for maybe five computers. A prediction that now is often
cited for comical effect as it was clearly so far off the mark
that it isn't even chartable. Or was it?

While in the beginning computers were huge behemoths that would
require separate houses or at least tracts, we are now at the
stage of ubiquitous computing. Chips the size of a match box
pack more computing power than the super computers of yore, cost
less than case of beer and can be found in everything down to
simple toasters.

But let's take a step back, forget of what "computer" means to us
and think about what it meant then. A computer in the mind of
the IBM executive was a facility used by many people in a time
sharing manner that stored data for them and executed their
algorithms. The computing infrastructure was a very centralized
world back then.

## Towards Decentralization ...

This changed with the advent of the personal computer.
Introduced by Apple, grudgingly adopted by IBM who rightly feared
it would eat into their mainframe business and championed by
Microsoft, the personal computer changed the landscape
fundamentally.

Everything was local now. The data was stored on your harddrive
that did not take up a complete room, the algorithms were
executed on your PC. Applications of from that era like Excel, Word or
Photoshop are based around the core assumption that data is local
and only one person is editing it at the same time. An assumption
that makes collaboration cumbersome and the features added to
facilitate it feel bolted on.  

## ... And Back

And along came the cloud. Imagine Amazon, Google, Microsoft,
Facebook and Rackspace turning off their data centers. How much
of the infrastructure you daily use would still be accessible?

Gmail down, Dropbox not here, Facebook gone, Office365
unavailable.

Remember when I mentioned how computer was defined in the head
of a IBM executive in the 1940s? The definition fits big cloud
providers like a glove.

We do not have more than five computers on this planet. This
is a very risky situation. With the rapid adoption of cloud
services we are putting ourselves at the mercy of a handful of
central players whose intentions are not aligned with ours.

Our data lies in silos, that are only accessible if the
gatekeepers let us in who also use their algorithms to analyze
our data for their profit, while we get the crumbs. Even if
the crumbs are yummy. Who wouldn't love a free awesome email
service or a place to easily keep in touch with your friends
and family.


## Towards Redecentralization Again

One of the reasons the Internet was designed without a central
authorative server was resilience. Even if whole sectors of
the Internet stop working, the rest could still function
normally.

It is time to take this lesson to heart and apply it to
services we use daily. Gmail, while great, is worthless if
Google decides you violated their usage policy and dangerous
if they hand over all your data to the government.

Facebook's main goal is to make money off your communication
with friends and loved ones.

If you want to read more about the dangers of relying on
centralized service I invite you to reread the [5 reasons
why you should take control of your own data](https://cloudfleet.io/blog/5-reasons-to-self-host.html).

It is time to prove the IBM executive wrong again. Like the
revolution of the personal computer, the revolution of the
__personal data center__ will put you back in control over your
data.

## Seven Billion Computers

The mission of CloudFleet is to make it possible for every
person on this planet to own their data. To be able to to this 
we package services, that hold make it possible for you to store
your data at home while making seamless collaboration possible.
