Summary: CloudFleet brings privacy and safety to your mails


## 1. Easily Encrypt Emails

Sending and receiving encrypted email used to be a
<span style="text-decoration: line-through">pain in the
ass</span> hard. You had to install an add on for your mail client or
use some external program to de- and encrypt email. Even if you mastered the
setup on one device, you could only read your encrypted emails there.

On your CloudFleet Blimp, your encryption key is created when you log in the
first time. Whenever you get an email from someone that shows this person can
receive encrypted mails, [Mailpile](https://mailpile.is) automatically encrypts
the mail for you. Also your public key fingerprint will be appended to your
email so others know that they can send you encrypted mails. Even better, you
can access you CloudFleet Blimp from every device you own, so checking emails on
your phone is easy.


## 2. Use Aliases to Reduce Spam

Often you need an email address to sign up for a web page, free wifi or other
services. Many times this results in a slew of unwanted spammy emails from them
 and everyone they sold your email address to.

With CloudFleet you can easily avoid this by creating a dedicated email address
for such occasions. Just use dontspamme@janedoe.name instead of your normal
address like me@janedoe.name that you give your friends. You can even create
separate email addresses for all these occasion to see who is selling you out to
spammers. It is just a mouse click away.

## 3. Enjoy An Ad-Free Experience

Ads turn free websites into billboards that try to sell you everything from
cars to insurance policies, carefully targeted to the content of your inbox.
That's because you are not their customer. Your attention is the resource they
sell to advertisement agencies.

On the CloudFleet user interface you will never see a single ad. We are not in
the business of selling your eyeballs out to advertisers. With CloudFleet you're
the customer, not the product.

## 4. Keep Your Emails Private

To be able to sell targeted ads, free webmail providers use your emails to
create accurate profiles of you that makes it easier to manipulate you into
buying something. To achieve this algorithms read and analyze every single one
of your mails including attachments like personal pictures or confidential
contracts. That's their business.

With CloudFleet nobody will read your emails. They are stored on your device,
protected by your encryption key and even we cannot access them.


## Import All Your Existing Emails from Gmail

Often when you switch email providers, it is hard to transfer all your data.

To make the transition to CloudFleet easier, you can import all your emails,
contacts and calendar entries from your Gmail account with one click.
