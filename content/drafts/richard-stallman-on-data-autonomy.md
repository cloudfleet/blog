Summary: Richard Stallman explains why you should host your data yourself

Why You Should Take Control of Your Own Data - Part 1
-----------------------------------------------------

We asked various people for their explanation why it is important to take
control of your own data.

Richard M. Stallman initiated the [Free Software Movement](http://www.fsf.org/)
that brought us great things like Linux and was a great inspiration for
CloudFleet. He gave us his statement at the Indie Tech Summit in July 2014 in
Brighton.

Listen to him explain why it is important to take control of your
own data.
