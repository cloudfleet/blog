Summary: Richard Stallman explains why you should host your data yourself

Why You Should Take Control of Your Own Data - Part 1
-----------------------------------------------------

We asked various people for their explanation why it is important to take
control of your own data.

Richard M. Stallman initiated the [Free Software Movement](http://www.fsf.org/)
that brought us great things like the [GNU/Linux operating system](http://gnu.org/gnu/linux-and-gnu.html)
and was a great inspiration for CloudFleet. He gave us his statement at the
Indie Tech Summit in July 2014 in Brighton.

Listen to him explain why it is important to take control of your
own data.
