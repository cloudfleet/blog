Summary: The Mission-Driven Startup

## TL;DR

This is a long blog post, longer and heavier than the average Captain's
Log. So if you are not into philosophical treatises here is the gist:

- The Lean Start-Up movement is great
- The methodology has to be taken with a grain of salt
- CloudFleet is not a lean start-up
- We at CloudFleet believe that tools to achieve Data Autonomy are too
  important to pivot from.
- Most transformative start-ups were only successful because the founders
  possessed a certain amount of stubbornness


## Eric Ries' Dream

When Eric Ries introduced the methodology of the lean start-up, he dreamed
of a systematic way that would allow start-up founders to succeed.

He assumed that the product-market fit is a necessary and almost sufficient
condition for the success of a start-up. Therefore the main goal of the
lean startup method is to attain it.

He challenges start-up founders to get out of the building to talk to people
about their needs and to validate the assumption about customers, that lie
at the core of the intended business model. Create theories,
identify the theory with the biggest uncertainty, test it. If it proves
wrong, change your business model, and repeat the process.

Who is reminded of a scientific experiment might be mistaken. Indeed it
closely mirrors the platonic ideal of scientific progress as laid out by
Karl Popper in [The Logic of Scientific Discovery](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Logic_of_Scientific_Discovery).

According to Ries "Start-up success is not a consequence of good genes or being
in the right place at the right time. Success can be engineered by following the
right process, which means it can be learned, which means it can be taught."



## Karl Popper's Dream

In his seminal writings about the scientific method, Karl Popper tried to
reconcile the practice of science with its logic foundations. Since
Aristotle two warring schools of thought had dominated the sciences.

According to the idealistic school, the insight about the nature comes from
the depth of our minds. Based on a few simple principles you would be able
to deduce truths about the world. This is how Aristotle build his physics.

For almost two millenia it was not only the dominant method in science,
also the principles laid down in his writings went largely unchallenged.

It took strong minded individuals like Galileo and Giordano Bruno, Copernicus
and Kepler, who - some at considerable personal expense - started deducing
the laws of the world from systematic and thorough observations and rattling
the cage of Aristotelian science, that had constricted.

One of the most fascinating works that show this method is Kepler's
groundbreaking work [Astronomia Nova](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astronomia_nova)
Almost every chapter starts with the proclamation how stupid he was upon
writing the preceding chapter. Of course it had nothing to do with him being
stupid, and all with the continuing refinement of his theories in his quest
to attain a theory-reality-fit.

Based on this new approach Hume and Locke developed the empirical method.
According to them all insight into the world stems from careful observation,
that by induction lead to theories about the world.

This concept suffered from one fatal flaw however. There is no logical
connection between the past and the future. The fact that the bus
came around the corner each day from Monday to Friday does not mean that it
will be on the same schedule on Saturday or Sunday.

Karl Popper proposed a solution. To predict the future, you have to create a
model that explains your past observations and makes predictions about the
future. Then you can "get out of the building" and test your assumptions,
just like you would do it for your start-up according to the lean start-up
method.

## Theory And Practice ...

Reality however is quite a bit messier than the nice white paper philosophical
concepts and theories are written upon. In his book [The Structure of Scientific
Revolutions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Structure_of_Scientific_Revolutions)
Thomas S. Kuhn analyzed how new ideas were introduced into and adopted by
the scientific community. In his research he found that few scientists
were ready to change their opinions when a new paradigm came around. Not the
least because most new paradigms initially have a worse reality theory fit
than the established ones, that had been refined and polished for decades.

Only when the champions of the old paradigm would start to retire from the
community and finally die out, the new paradigm - now also refined and
polished - would prevail. Also Popper's followers like Imre Lakatos
acknowledged the fact that scientific progress usually did not follow the
platonic ideal of Popper's method and in [Against Method](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Against_Method)
Paul Feyerabend delivered a scathing critique of it.

Despite these criticism the basic idea, that a scientific theory should
make testable predictions is still the universally accepted gold standard
for science.

## ... in the Start-Up World

People that found Start-Ups are usually passionate about their idea. It
doesn't work if they are not. The brain has to justify working countless
hours on a project with a high probability of failure, eschewing the
amenities and material benefits of a steady job in an established company
most people working on a start-up would have no difficulty to get.

If you are very passionate about your idea, it is difficult to let it go.
Focusing on hunting the elusive product market fit by means of iterate
and pivot can also be a distraction from delivering a product that really
makes a difference.

Google wasn't built after a carefully tuned process to attain a market fit.
Neither were Apple, AirBnB or Dropbox. Needless to say talking to your
prospective customers is of uttermost importance. You have to identify what
their pain is and think hard how you can solve that. But do not forget
Henry Ford's wisdom who said "If I had asked people what they want, they
would have said faster horses". Transformative, disruptive ideas are not
born in an iterative process, they are forged in the fires of passion.

## The Mission of CloudFleet

CloudFleet is such an idea. We are not interested in changing a corner of
the world. We will change how people think about their data and the
algorithms that control them.

Of course listening to users and making sure our user experience is great
is of uttermost important to us. But the core axiom, that the world needs
an easy to use, distributed system where the data is under control
of the people, this is not negotiable.

Join us on this journey and be part of the next revolution in computing!
