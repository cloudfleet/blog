## Introducing: our crowdfunding campaign!

As you might have seen from our extensive tweets, our team is currently in Hamburg attending Chaos Communication Congress. For the last few weeks, we've been focusing on updating all of our technical documentation, which you can now look at into detail [here](https://cloudfleet.readthedocs.org). In-between workshops, talks, and a Mailpile hackathon the day before yesterday, we've managed to get talking to some fellow CCC-ers and got a lot of input, interest and feedback. If you're at CCC, we'd love to meet you — contact us via [twitter](https://twitter.com/cloudfleetio) if you want to have a chat about CloudFleet.  

We're also pretty excited about our crowd-funding campaign, which we launched yesterday; if you don't want to miss being among one of our very first backers, head to our [campaign page](https://cloudfleet.io/crowdfunding). If you believe that privacy should be a right and not a privilege, we'd really love to have your support; even a few bucks count! On our crowd-funding page, you will be able to see a breakdown of the timeline for the next few months, to understand what the efforts and money will go towards. Apart from the CloudFleet "blimp" itself, some of the other perks we offer are thank you notes, an exclusive CloudFleet T-Shirt, just the service subscriptions — for the tinkerers among you who prefer to build the blimp with their own hardware.
