Summary: Introducing the Captain of the Data Blizzard

### Introducing the Captain of the Data Blizzard

Today we'll start to introduce our team members, starting with our Captain of the Data Blizzard: Dražen Lučanin. Dražen is one of the co-founders of CloudFleet and was born and raised in Zagreb, Croatia. He studied computer science there, before moving to Vienna to work as a research assistant and do his PhD at the Vienna University of Technology. He also did several smaller research/development projects for the University of Vienna and Ruđer Bošković Institute.  

Dražen was always around computers, from playing games as a kid to his computer science studies. He got very interested in Open Source during his studies and became a heavy user of Linux. This led to him contributing as much as he could, with patches and bug reports. 


#### What is your background? What did you study, what job experience do you have and in which field(s)?

I was always around computers, from playing games as a kid to later on studying computer science at the University of Zagreb. After graduating, I came to Vienna to work as a research assistant and do my PhD at the Vienna University of Technology. I also did several smaller research/development projects for the University of Vienna and Ruđer Bošković Institute. Also, I got very interested in open source during my studies, so I've been a heavy user of Linux and tried to contribute where I could with patches and bug reports.
 
#### What is your role in CloudFleet?

I am mainly a backend developer, responsible for the centralised CloudFleet services like Spire for Blimp ordering, Pagekite for tunneling traffic, the API for authentication and uploading SSL certificates etc. I am also hacking on the physical devices to set up correct images and have recently started working on Marina, our service for more dependable Docker ARM image building. I mostly write code in Python, although JavaScript, Bash and other technologies are not foreign to me either.
 
#### Are you currently fully involved in CloudFleet? If not, where do you work/what do you do?

So far I've just been working in my free time, but I am just finishing up my PhD and will start freelancing and hopefully investing more hours every week working on CloudFleet.

#### What are some of your current interests and hobbies?

I have played the guitar since I was 8. In high school it was mostly heavy metal I was interested in, while now I've shifted more towards classic rock, progressive rock. I have a band called Nehaj that's currently mostly operating "in the cloud" due to our geographical dispersion. I'm waiting for some killer web service to appear that will allow us to continue more productively like that :)

Also, I like to do things that take me away from the screen from time to time like drawing (I do this webcomic in Croatian called "Epic Adventure" now and then http://epska.org/ ).

To stay healthy I cycle around town and go skiing, hiking or swimming depending on the weather.
 
#### Why are you interested in privacy?

People should be free to talk to whomever they like, without unwanted eavesdropping. We take it for granted when the medium is air and I think that other mediums (like the web) should be no different.
 
#### In what ways do you think CloudFleet can solve the problem of privacy?

Given our current technological advances it should be as difficult as it is to achieve both privacy and ease of use. With CloudFleet we want to show how it should be done.
 
#### What makes you a valuable asset to CloudFleet?

I've been hacking together servers and Rapsberry Pis for myself and others in my household for years. With CloudFleet, I am simply looking to take what I've learned so far and enable others to set up similar systems without investing that much time. Also, through my research, development work and involvement with open source projects, I think I've obtained skills in development, organisation and communication that can be helpful to make CloudFleet a successful project.
