Summary: Introducing the Admiral of the Clouds

## Introducing the Admiral of the Clouds

We're back for our second team member introduction: Christoph Witzany. Christoph is the other co-founder of CloudFleet, and is originally from Klagenfurt. A lover of decentralization and software development, while growing up he split his time between chess, programming Conway's Game of life or galaxy simulations, and physics.

## What is your background? What did you study, what job experience do you have and in which field(s)?
I started physics at the TU Wien but switched to Computer Science and Economics; since my master thesis, I worked on my
goal of decentralizing Grid and cloud computing. Most of the time I help developing sustainable workflows for
development, deployment and security. I also built MVPs for startups like treats., crosho or fittrack.

## What is your role in CloudFleet?
Chief visionary and first engineer. I created and implemented the basic architecture of the software that runs on
CloudFleet devices. I also designed the workflows that make sure the privacy of our users is protect at the maximum
possible level. Now that we have other very talented engineers on board most I spend most of my time convincing people
that what we do will change the world.

## What are some of your current interests and hobbies?
I love dancing dancing. I competed in latin ballroom dances and Rock'n'Roll acrobatics and with the right music my feet
just won't keep still. To quote Emma Goldman: A revolution without dancing is a revolution not worth having. I also
really love good stories and whenever I find time I work on my novel.

## Why are you interested in privacy?
I was going around telling people of my vision of a decentralized cloud. I distinctively remeber one evening where
people were telling me that people did not care. The next morning I woke up to Snowden's revelations about mass
surveillance. 
I think the centralization of power that is brought on by government and corporate surveillance is a danger to human
freedom and must be reigned in.

## In what ways do you think CloudFleet can solve the problem of privacy?
CloudFleet enables everybody to take back the control over their data without relinquishing the possibility to analyze
and learn from it.

## What makes you a valuable asset to CloudFleet?
My experience in Software Engineering and Computer Security, my passion for decentralization and my conviction that CloudFleet is needed.
