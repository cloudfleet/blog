Summary: Introducing the Admiral of the Clouds

## Introducing the Admiral of the Clouds

We're back for our second team member introduction: Christoph Witzany. Christoph is the other co-founder of CloudFleet, and is originally from Klagenfurt. A lover of decentralization and software development, while growing up he split his time between chess, programming Conway's Game of life or galaxy simulations, and physics.

## What is your background? What did you study, what job experience do you have and in which field(s)?

I started physics at the TU Wien but switched to Computer Science and Economics; since my master thesis, I dreamt of decentralizing Grid and cloud computing. I also worked as a Software Developer in different roles.

## What is your role in CloudFleet?
Chief visionary and first engineer. Convincing people that what we do will change the world.

## Are you currently fully involved in CloudFleet? If not, where do you work/what do you do?  
While cloudfleet is the first and last thing on my mind, I help other people developing
sustainable workflows for development, deployment and security and sometimes build MVPs for startups like treats., crosho or fittrack.

## What are some of your current interests and hobbies?
Dancing. A revolution without dancing is a revolution not worth having.

## Why are you interested in privacy?
I think the centralization of power that is brought on by government and corporate surveillance is a danger to human freedom and must be curtailed.

## In what ways do you think CloudFleet can solve the problem of privacy?
CloudFleet enables everybody to take back the control over their data without relinquishing the possibility to analyze and learn from it.

## What makes you a valuable asset to CloudFleet?
My experience in Software Engineering and Computer Security, my passion for decentralization and my conviction that CloudFleet is needed.
