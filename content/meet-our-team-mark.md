Summary: Introducing our Commodore x40

## Introducing our Commodore x40

We're back for our third team member introduction: Mark Evenson is yet
another co-founder of CloudFleet.  Mark was born in Springfield, but
with five digits on each hand.  Although he holds a jaundiced view of
software development, his natural pigmentation is not yellow.


## What is your background? What did you study, what job experience do you have and in which field(s)?

After growing up in various parts of the world, Mark eventually made
it to Cornell University in Ithaca, NY, where, overwhelmed by the
possiblities, he attempted to train himself to be able to read any
book on his own later on.  While working through a Physics degree with
a concentraion in Mathematics, and having extensive exposure to the
pre-commerical Internet, Mark became more interested in the
computational aspects of working with a near-infrared astrononmy group
attempting to image proto-stellar disks around nearby suns.  This led
to a stint designing a virtual reality operating system (MOSES) at the
Human Interface Technology Laboratory in Seattle, WA.  After drifting
around the states in an '87 Civic hatchback, washing dishes and
writing poetry, Mark ended up in New York City on the day of Clinton's
first inauguration.  Quickly swept up in the commericializing
Internet, Mark worked for a variety of established firms and scrappy
startups at the daybreak of what we now know as the World Wide Web.

## What is your role in CloudFleet?

Mark is a Jack-of-all-trades and a master of none.  Currently, he
coordinates the engineering activities towards our "First Customer Ship",
part of which consists in designing and implementing a zero-knowledge
backup system.

##  Are you currently fully involved in CloudFleet? If not, where do you work/what do you do?

As a co-founder, Mark is currently "all-in" towards the minimal viable
product ship date.  Most recently, Mark architected, developed and
deployed a "full stack" next generation Electronic Health Record
system rooted in semantics (first order description logics) for the
University at Buffalo School of Dental Medicine.  Dynamically compiled
Javascript was delivered as a HTML5 client which securely connected
via TLS to a Java Virtual Machine based application server.

## What are some of your current interests and hobbies?

When he gets the time, Mark continues to do recreations Mathematics,
where he is working on a taxonomy of various known quantum algorithms.
And he makes what time he can to go surfing, on real waves on a real
beach.

## Why are you interested in privacy?

Instinctively, I have always been an online privacy advocate since the
first days of dialing up local BBS numbers via a 300 bp/s modem from
my Commodore 64 in the 1980s.  Over the years, my interest in privacy
has come down to the realization that we only get to build one
Internet: one where everyone can be spied on, or one on which no one
can be spied on.  Privacy is not just about hiding things, it is also
about how we assert control over creating out public persona.

## In what ways do you think CloudFleet can solve the problem of privacy?

Without a local computation capable of being verified for
trust one cannot know that the interconnected computer systems we are
using are not simulations of the ones we expect.  Simulations to the
point that they either inadvertently or maliciously compromise control
of our own data.

## What makes you a valuable asset to CloudFleet?

A determination to not let the "Snowden moment" pass into history
without having said that I did not try to make a different world.
