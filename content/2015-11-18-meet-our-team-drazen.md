## Introducing the Captain of the Data Blizzard

<img class="intro-image" src="{filename}/img/Drazen.png" style="float: left; width: 25%; margin: 0.5em">
Today we'll start to introduce our team members, starting with our Captain of
the Data Blizzard: Dražen Lučanin. Dražen is one of the co-founders of
CloudFleet and was born and raised in Zagreb, Croatia.

Dražen was always around computers, from playing games as a kid to his computer
science studies. "I've been hacking together servers and Raspberry Pis for
myself and others in my household for years. I'm looking to take what I've
learned so far and enable others to have similar systems without investing
that much time."

He studied computer science in Zagreb before moving to Vienna to work as a research
assistant and pursue his PhD at the Vienna University of Technology. He also
completed several smaller research/development projects for the University of
Vienna and Ruđer Bošković Institute.  


## The Responsibilities of a Captain

His main responsibility lies in making sure that it is easy to order and set up
a CloudFleet device and that all backend services work. He also developed
the system that makes sure that all communication with the device and data on it
is encrypted. "Through my research, development work and involvement with open
source projects, I have learned what it takes to build dependable distributed
systems."

When asked about what motivates him to work on a project that aims to give
people more privacy, he mentions the right to communicate without unwanted
eavesdropping. "We take it for granted in the face-to-face context and I think
that other media, like the web, should be no different." He's convinced that our
technological advances make it possible to achieve both privacy and ease of use.
"With CloudFleet, we do the hard work for you."

## Off The Helm

His creative side extends beyond the work he does for CloudFleet. He's been an
avid guitar player since he was eight, where his journey started with heavy
metal and ventured later into the territory of classic rock and rock. "I have a
band called Nehaj that's currently mostly operating 'in the cloud' due to our
geographical dispersion." He's still waiting for some killer web service that
will allow them to continue playing together despite the distance.

To rest his eyes from the screen he likes drawing. "I do this webcomic in
Croatian called [Epic Adventure](http://epska.org/) about a band of slightly
incompetent characters trying to be epic heroes now and then."

To stay healthy, he cycles around town and enjoys skiing, hiking and swimming.
