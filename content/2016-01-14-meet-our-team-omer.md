## Introducing our Major Shred

The circle is almost complete, and today we're publishing one of our last team member introductions: Meet our "Major Shred" Ömer Ayasli, born in Berlin (during his father's diplomatic post for the Turkish government) but a world citizen who finally settled in Vienna in 2003 after living in Turkey, Australia and the US.  
After studying in Heidelberg and Istanbul and getting his degree in International business, Ömer — a believer in self-development and personal progression — wanted to keep learning, so he self-taught himself Network Engineering over the course of two years: "Even though having a business degree was interesting, I wanted to work in Information Technology, which at the time was more attractive". He pursued his career in Network Engineering after moving to Vienna in 2003, where he worked for — among others — Siemens, Alcatel and the United Nations. But his expertise does not stop there: He is passionate about social dynamics and coaches people in business, communication and social interaction.  

## Strategy management done right

For CloudFleet, Ömer handles the business and strategy management; his knowledge and expertise in business and sales, coupled with his attention to detail and passion for optimizing processes, makes him the perfect candidate for our product development as well. So far, he's also taken care of the promotional photography and video shoots at the core of our crowdfunding campaign. When asked what his role in CloudFleet is, his full commitment to our company while launching our product is apparent: "Like the oil in an engine, I make sure everything runs just right".

## An extreme sportsman at heart

In his free time, Ömer does independent sales in extreme sports equipment and used to compete in races as a semi-pro snowboarder in the ISF circuit. He strongly believes in the "healthy body, healthy mind" maxim; he works out regularly to keep his body and mind in sync, and as a licensed kitesurfing and snowboarding instructor, he is an avid extreme sportsman: "I try to find peace and calm in the chaos of extreme sports; it's my own form of meditation". 

## The state of freedom on the internet

"We are giving away our freedom and privacy at an incredible pace, for free", Ömer says about the current state of the internet. "We have entered an era of globalisation and connectivity on a scale never seen before. Unfortunately, nobody seems to care about or see the future negative impact that mass surveillance may have on our society". Because of this government and corporation dream come true, he believes that we are lying to ourselves — certain we are living a free and independent life while, in fact, we are more controlled by mathematical algorithms and media influence than ever before.  
He feels strongly about this topic, and knows CloudFleet could make a difference; decentralising data and keeping it local on your premises is the only way to make sure your data stays in your own hands. The strong mission that CloudFleet is driven by is the reason he joined in the first place; with his resourcefulness and energy, he is an integral part of CloudFleet's recipe for success.  
"When Cloudfleet is faced with a problem, Major Shred is the man to call."
